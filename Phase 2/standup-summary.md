At the point of the second standup, we have managed to create low and medium fidelity prototypes for our mobile application now named `Blaze`. Some experimentation has also been done with the Facebook and Instagram APIs, and it has been decided that the functional prototype for project will focus on the Instagram side of the concept. This is due to the Facebook API being difficult to get permissions for.

Progress has been a little slow over the past couple weeks, but the next steps for our group will be to:

 * Figure out the survey questions to ask each user on the Instagram side of the app, psychology research may be a good place to find information about how these questions should be asked

 * Conduct user testing for the prototype we have at this stage. By end of the semester, we will need to have conducted tested, refined based on the results, iterated again and done user testing a further time.
