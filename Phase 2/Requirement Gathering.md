### User Testing (paper prototype)

Using the paper prototype, our team proceeded to conduct user testing and gather additional feedback. We also worked concurrently to develop the pages on invisionapp, incorporating colours and designing a workflow for the prototype.

The plan was to obtain feedback from the paper prototype and incorporate changes to the medium-fidelity prototype on invsionapp. 


### Invisionapp Development

The actionable feedback we gathered from the paper prototype are:

- Consider reducing the number of tabs on the homepage (combine some of them if similar), some could be confusing and repetitive.
- Keep the colour of the interface simple and similar to Facebook and Instagram if possible.
- Consider having more selections for the drop down nav bar.

### Changes 

Based on the feedback received, we made the necessary changes to the interface to make the app more intuitive and easy to navigate. 
The main key change was the words used for the options in the homepage. We observed that some of the participants were taking some time to understand the words on the homepage when executing the tasks given.
