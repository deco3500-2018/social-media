“The side-bar need lines to represent each button”  
“More screens need to be created e.g. settings screen”  

Interview Questions:  
Was there any task you had difficulty with? What specifically was difficult?  
Not really, but if I were to choose one out of the three it would be editing my mobile number.   
Was there anything in particular that wasn’t intuitive? Why?  
The ratings page needed to have more questions because “Next question” brings me to the next screen.   
Do you have any suggestions on how to improve the layout of the pages?  
The information about social media habits has too many text for people to read but if it is like a readme file then that’s fine.   
Do you have any suggestions on how to improve the navigation between the pages?  
Back button to go back to the previous page  
Logout through the side-bar    
Do you think this is something you would use? If not, what would need to change for you to use it?  
Honestly, I will use it to remove friends because I always wanted to remove friends from Facebook but do not have the time. I do not think I am really interested to connect with my old friends. After all, I can just talk to them if I want to.
