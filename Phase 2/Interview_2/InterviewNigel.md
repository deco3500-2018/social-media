Comments throughout the tasks:  
“Intuitive”    
“interface a bit over-complicated. maybe can combine ‘friends list’ and ‘least active friends’, and also combine ‘unhealthy socials’ and ‘healthy socials”  

Interview Questions:  
Was there any task you had difficulty with? What specifically was difficult?  
“No it wasn’t difficult. Everything was pretty straightforward and clear-cut.”  

Was there anything in particular that wasn’t intuitive? Why?  
“Interface was intuitive. (text and images good)”  

Do you have any suggestions on how to improve the layout of the pages?  
“As mentioned earlier, interface was a bit complicated. Some of the options can be merged to simplify app usage.”  

Do you have any suggestions on how to improve the navigation between the pages?  
“No. The navigation was quite intuitive.”  
  



Do you think this is something you would use? If not, what would need to change for you to use it?  
“Manually, on my own time, I would clear my Facebook friends list of “online friends” whom I haven't spoken to in awhile. However, this app simplifies this job a lot for me. Personally, I wouldn't mind using it but I wouldn't heavily rely/use this app.”  

Any other comments?  
“Show the interactive prototype of the app before doing the survey. Invisionapp? So that I can provide more feedback.”  

Card Sorting:  

Which cards were hard to sort and why?  
“They are easy to sort. I would recommend combining the pages to simplify it.”   
Which cards were easy to categorise?  
“Settings.”  
If there were any cards you couldn’t fit into a category, could you provide a new category for these cards?  
“Social Habits page. Maybe I will categories it under tips for using social media?”
