Comments throughout the tasks:  
“It was easy to navigate”  
“Similar to facebook, with additional pages such as “Least Active Friends” which Facebook does not have, thus not familiar with the function”
“On friends list page, when you click onto a name, should it automatically direct to the person’s profile or should it go to the remove friend’s page? I am confused with this portion cause intuitively, it should open up the person’s profile and let me view his/her information”  

Interview Questions:  
Was there any task you had difficulty with? What specifically was difficult?  
“No. Easy to navigate.”  

Was there anything in particular that wasn’t intuitive? Why?  
“No, but the ratings page felt redundant to me as the user more than often will not need to know that, or it might be more applicable to the app developer. Rating page once is sufficient because there will be no change in second or third time asking it.”  

Do you have any suggestions on how to improve the layout of the pages?  
“Color option wise. Consider having something more vibrant yet not too much.”  



Do you have any suggestions on how to improve the navigation between the pages?  
“It is quite easy to navigate since I’m an avid user of social media apps, similar to facebook.”  
Do you think this is something you would use? If not, what would need to change for you to use it?  
“Yes I would, because I noticed that I have a lot of friends in my friends list that I do not connect to, or some whom I may not actually know in real life.”
Any other comments?  
“Nil. keep the background colour simple in the invisionapp prototype.”  

Card Sorting:  

Which cards were hard to sort and why?  
“I do not know the purpose of least active friends page. It can be combined with friends list page to make things simple? Friends list page is sufficient to provide information to know who are the people you least contact.”  
Which cards were easy to categorise?    
“Settings and games.”  
If there were any cards you couldn’t fit into a category, could you provide a new category for these cards?  
“Rating page is on its own. Categorised it under survey?”
