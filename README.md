# 3.0 Project Summary 

Our project aims to keep our social media (Facebook and Instagram) sanitized with people whom we truly know and promote a healthy usage of such platforms. We seek to develop a prototype to enhance users’ relationships with their friends on social media by sorting friends to designated groups (e.g. least contacted). Users can then decide whether they want to retain such friends or remove them. 

In essence, it forces them to stop and ponder, “Do we really know this person and want them to have access to our information?” The odds are, they do not.

We also strived to develop a working and presentable prototype which presents a solution for helping young adults effectively manage social media and prevent feelings of overwhelm. This could come in the form of a web/mobile application, or follow an interaction paradigm such as tangible or persuasive computing.

# 4.0 Project Process

## Phase 1
### Research 

From the initial research conducted, we found the use of social networks such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat can lead to reductions in well-being related to lowered self-confidence and life satisfaction, feelings of exclusion, anxiety, lowered self-awareness, depression and loneliness. It is commonly understood that these effects arise from users comparing themselves with others, leading to social media platforms becoming a 'competition' for beauty and self-image.

We also found out that social network users tend to be more well connected, greater social connectedness also doesn't necessarily translate into meaningful and authentic friendships in reality. Social network use has also been shown to reduce numbers and lower quality of face-to-face interactions overall.

On the other hand, prior research conducted before the beginning of the project also showed that there are undeniably 'good' aspects to the use of social media. These are features that contribute positively to well-being, and include:

Sharing feelings and stories
Learning and understanding the self through writing and self-expression
Finding out about real-life events, leading to 'traditional' social interaction 
Building friendships 

Overall, social networks may be looked at as a double-edged sword for teens and young adults. Among other things, they are a source of anxiety and concern for self-image, but also a method through which they can build friendships, express themselves and learn.

### interviews/surveys

Our team started with drafting interview questions and surveys to gather an unbiased approach to decision-making for our prototype. We aim to collect unbiased survey data and develop sensible decisions based on analyzed results. 

- interviews' results shown and conclude findings

### our design and wireframe

Our team moved on with coming up with some low fidelity prototype using Microsoft Word.  

# phase2
#### Requirement Gathering


### user testing (paper prototype)
- need some 'sketches' and wireframes to show the process

### invisionapp development

- getting feedback from the user testing on the paper prototype user testing

## Phase 3
### user testing on invisionapp 

we did user testing using the invisionapp and gathered some feedback.

the main (actionable) feedback were that:
- colour on the pages were too bright, consider following the layout on instagram and fb with white background colour. 
- the homepage tabs looks kinda confusing, consider rewording them or combine some of them together. such as least active friends can combine with friend list tab and healthy social habits tab can combine with unhealthy social habits tab.
- rating page was redundant? considering removing it or only ask once when the user logs in for the first time?
- keep background colour simple
- purpose of least active friends page is unclear
- rating opage is for?

conclusion
layout is intuitive, workflow is there and easy to navigate around due to the text and images. some minor touch up to be made to make it better. 

### final touch up

we made changes to the colour on the homepage and also changed the words used to create 'familiarity' for the users as they mentioned that it's currently intuitive due to the fact that it looked similar to facebook and instagram.

- design challenges and findings (tried marvel app but changed to invisionapp, challenges faced using marvel app were?)
