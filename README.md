## 3.0 Project Summary 

Our project aims to keep our social media (Facebook and Instagram) sanitized with people whom we truly know and promote a healthy usage of such platforms. We seek to develop a prototype to enhance users’ relationships with their friends on social media by sorting friends to designated groups (e.g. least contacted). Users can then decide whether they want to retain such friends or remove them. 

In essence, it forces them to stop and ponder, “Do we really know this person and want them to have access to our information?” The odds are, they do not.

We also strived to develop a working and presentable prototype which presents a solution for helping young adults effectively manage social media and prevent feelings of overwhelm. This could come in the form of a web/mobile application, or follow an interaction paradigm such as tangible or persuasive computing.

## 4.0 Project Process

### Phase 1

#### Research 

From the initial research conducted, we found the use of social networks such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat can lead to reductions in well-being related to lowered self-confidence and life satisfaction, feelings of exclusion, anxiety, lowered self-awareness, depression and loneliness. It is commonly understood that these effects arise from users comparing themselves with others, leading to social media platforms becoming a 'competition' for beauty and self-image.

At this phase, we are trying to gather as much information as we could by conducting primary and secondary research (interviews and online research). We had some raw ideas for our main concept but still unsure if it is good for users or it will be a good solution, therefore, we implemented this phase and analyze the results from there. 

Overall, social networks may be deemed a double-edged sword for teens and young adults. Amongst other things, they are a source of anxiety and concern for self-image, but also a method through which people can build friendships, express themselves and learn.

#### our design and wireframe

Our team moved on with coming up with some low fidelity prototype using Microsoft Word.

### phase2

### Requirement Gathering

#### User Testing (paper prototype)

Using the paper prototype, our team proceeded to conduct user testing and gather additional feedback. We also worked concurrently to develop the pages on invisionapp, incorporating colours and designing a workflow for the prototype.

The plan was to obtain feedback from the paper prototype and incorporate changes to the medium-fidelity prototype on invsionapp. 

### Phase 3

#### User Testing on Invisionapp 

We conducted user testing using invisionapp and gathered the following feedback:
- The colour on the pages was too bright. Consider following the layout on Instagram and Facebook which used white as their background colour. 
- The homepage tabs appeared confusing. Consider rewording them or combining some of them together. For instance, least active friends could be combined with the friend list tab while healthy social habits tab could be combined with unhealthy social habits tab.
- The rating page was redundant. Consider removing it or only asking upon the user’s first login to the site. 
- The purpose of the least active friends page was unclear.

In conclusion, we found that the overall layout was intuitive and the site was relatively easy to navigate due to the straightforward workflow. Having said that, some minor amendments would simplify the site’s content and design, thereby enhancing the overall user experience.


### Final Touch Up

We made changes to the colour scheme and wording of the homepage to create 'familiarity' for the users. This was in response to their comments that similarities to Facebook and Instagram would serve to enhance their overall ease of usage. The number of tabs was also reduced to prevent the site from looking cluttered and overwhelming users with information. Ultimately, this would help to draw users’ attention to key content and direct their focus accordingly.
