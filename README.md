# 3.0 Project Summary

Our project aims to keep our social media (Facebook and Instagram) sanitized with people whom we truly know and promote a healthy usage of such platforms. We seek to develop a prototype to enhance users’ relationships with their friends on social media by sorting friends to designated groups (e.g. least contacted). Users can then decide whether they want to retain such friends or remove them. 

In essence, it forces them to stop and ponder, “Do we really know this person and want them to have access to our information?” The odds are, they do not.

# 4 Project Process

## Phase 1
### Research 

From the initial research conducted, we found the use of social networks such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat can lead to reductions in well-being related to lowered self-confidence and life satisfaction, feelings of exclusion, anxiety, lowered self-awareness, depression and loneliness. It is commonly understood that these effects arise from users comparing themselves with others, leading to social media platforms becoming a 'competition' for beauty and self-image.

We also found out that social network users tend to be more well connected, greater social connectedness also doesn't necessarily translate into meaningful and authentic friendships in reality. Social network use has also been shown to reduce numbers and lower quality of face-to-face interactions overall.

(maybe take away the positive portion?)
On the other hand, prior research conducted before the beginning of the project also showed that there are undeniably 'good' aspects to the use of social media. These are features that contribute positively to well-being, and include:

Sharing feelings and stories
Learning and understanding the self through writing and self-expression
Finding out about real-life events, leading to 'traditional' social interaction 
Building friendships 

Overall, social networks may be looked at as a double-edged sword for teens and young adults. Among other things, they are a source of anxiety and concern for self-image, but also a method through which they can build friendships, express themselves and learn.

### our design and wireframe


# phase2
#### Requirement

### interviews/surveys

- interviews' results shown and conclude findings

### user testing (paper prototype)
- need some 'sketches' and wireframes to show the process

### invisionapp development

- getting feedback from the user testing on the paper prototype user testing

## Phase 3
### user testing on invisionapp 
### final touch up
- design challenges and findings (tried marvel app but changed to invisionapp, challenges faced using marvel app were?)
### end product
