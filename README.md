## 3.0 Project Summary 

Our project aims to keep our social media (Facebook and Instagram) sanitized with people whom we truly know and promote a healthy usage of such platforms. We seek to develop a prototype to enhance users’ relationships with their friends on social media by sorting friends to designated groups (e.g. least contacted). Users can then decide whether they want to retain such friends or remove them. 

In essence, it forces them to stop and ponder, “Do we really know this person and want them to have access to our information?” The odds are, they do not.

We also strived to develop a working and presentable prototype which presents a solution for helping young adults effectively manage social media and prevent feelings of overwhelm. This could come in the form of a web/mobile application, or follow an interaction paradigm such as tangible or persuasive computing.

## 4.0 Project Process

### Phase 1

#### Research 

From the initial research conducted, we found the use of social networks such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat can lead to reductions in well-being related to lowered self-confidence and life satisfaction, feelings of exclusion, anxiety, lowered self-awareness, depression and loneliness. It is commonly understood that these effects arise from users comparing themselves with others, leading to social media platforms becoming a 'competition' for beauty and self-image.

We also discovered that while social network users tend to be more well connected, greater social connectedness does not necessarily translate into meaningful and authentic friendships in reality. Social network use has also been shown to reduce the numbers and  quality of face-to-face interactions overall.

On the other hand, prior research conducted before the commencement of the project showed that there are also 'good' aspects to the use of social media. These are features that contribute positively to well-being, and include the following examples:

- Sharing feelings and stories
- Learning and understanding the self through writing and self-expression
- Finding out about real-life events, leading to 'traditional' social interaction 
- Building friendships 

Overall, social networks may be deemed a double-edged sword for teens and young adults. Amongst other things, they are a source of anxiety and concern for self-image, but also a method through which people can build friendships, express themselves and learn.


#### Existing solutions and critique

##### Articles

The solutions focused on addressing the negative effects of well-being caused by social media are largely educational and campaigns which spread awareness of these after-effects of excessive social media usage. 

In our analysis of solutions available, we found several articles on popular websites detailing why and how users should detach their lives from social media. The key articles can be accessed via the links stated below:

* [5 Reasons Why You Should Start Deleting Facebook Friends | MakeUseOf](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-reasons-start-deleting-facebook-friends/)
* [Can Deleting Facebook Friends Improve Your Life? | Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/blog/millennial-media/201108/can-deleting-facebook-friends-improve-your-life)
* [Unfollowing all my Facebook friends | Damián Le Nouaille, Medium](https://medium.com/@damln/unfollowing-all-my-facebook-friends-part-1-730ae3bc2de3)
* [Smartphones are driving us to distraction. Here’s help. | ComputerWorld](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3233286/smartphones/smartphones-are-driving-us-to-distraction-here-s-help.html)

Notably, the third article, whichh detailed how readers should unfollow all of their Facebook friends along with groups, organizations and public figures appeared to be the most intriguing. The desired outcome of the method described was to completely clear one's Facebook feed. While this was thought to be rather drastic, its main advantage would be that users would still be connected with all of their Facebook friends. The act of "unfriending" may be perceived by others as a hostile action. However, unfollowing achieves the same result, without the negative impact on how others view the user.

The main problem with these educational articles is that while readers may understand why they should reduce their footprint on social media after reading them, they are not driven to take action or change their exisiting habits that.

##### RSPH Awareness Campaigns
![#StatusOfMind Report Cover](https://www.rsph.org.uk/uploads/assets/derivatives/featuredpanelimage_852bc4924d42a7dc79b182d4b566e15c/f031018f-3134-4da1-91b802d2889fa67d.jpg)

The Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) from the UK has a social media campaign for raising awareness about social media called #StatusOfMind, which is backed by a report and several articles detailing their discovered adverse effects of social media. More recently, they have also been running a ScrollFreeSeptember campaign, which encourages youth to turn off social media over the month of September.

While the campaigns appear to be efficacious, their impact is difficult to assess as they were centred in the UK, hence the level of awareness reached by these campaigns is not apparent in Australia. However, one identified advantage of the RSPH initiatives is that the ScrollFreeSeptember campaign encourages viewers to enforce such behaviour over the course of an entire month. Hence, participants would be able to experience the benefits of eliminating social media from their lives, potentially adjusting their habits thereafter. Another advantage is that the #StatusOfMind campaign emphasised that certain social networks have more positive impacts than others. YouTube was acclaimed as the healthiest social network while Instagram was touted as the worst.

It is important to note that the key disadvantage of such campaigns is the adoption of drastic measures. By asking participants to halt their usage of social media, ScrollFreeSeptember removes both the positive and negative effects of social media. Similarly, in encouraging users to spend more time on YouTube than Instagram in the #StatusOfMind campaign, the RSPH has missed that those two platforms help users in different ways. "Social networking" on YouTube is one largely one-sided, and almost all users spend significantly more time consuming than contributing content.


##### DistractaGone

![DistractaGone smartphone locker](https://ph-files.imgix.net/99cacdbb-920c-4427-9db2-72158e21362d?auto=format&auto=compress&codec=mozjpeg&cs=strip)

In our search for products (either software or physical) which addressed the problem space, very little was found. The sole solution found was DistractaGone, a box which can lock smartphones for a specified period of time. This solution not only stops users from accessing social media, but all other features available on their smartphones. It is believed that while DistractaGone may eliminate smartphone distractions over short periods of time, it is not a long-term solution for the excessive usage of social media. When users do not think that their full attention is required elsewhere, they may fall back to their old habits and continue using social media regularly, thereby experiencing the same changes in well-being that usually result from that. 

#### Our Designs

The existing solutions found all take an all-or-nothing approach to social media. Users are encouraged to delete a large number of friends, unfollow everyone, stop social media usage entirely, or physically restrict themselves from using their phones. What should be recognised is that by doing this, users would close themselves off from the legitimate benefits which social networks may bring. This could be the reason that the methods stated above have not gained popularity. As stated in the section below, the prototypes developed in this project will aim to be flexible in permitting the usage of social media, while optimising it to achieve the maximum benefits possible.

### Design Opportunity / Concepts

The design opportunity of this project is to enhance the quality of time on social media for young adults by encouraging activities which provide a boost in well-being while discouraging activities which are known to be negative. More specifically, we want to encourage aspects of social media such as direct communication with peers, building close friendships, expression of self and discovery of real-life events while discouraging comparison of self with others and concerns about self-image.

As there are no existing solutions to the problem space which uses technology to shape users’ behaviour, this would be an interesting design opportunity to explore. The final presented solution may come in the form of a mobile application, web application or tangible computing device and may use persuasive computing ideas to change behaviour.

Some initial concepts with elaboration that we intend to explore can be found under Wiki/project proposal

#### interviews/surveys

Our team conducted interviews and surveys to facilitate decision-making with regard to our prototype. We sought to collect unbiased data and make sensible decisions based on the evaluation of results. 

The top three solutions favoured by respondents were “Stay in Touch”, “Response Reminder” and “Social Networking Score”. Overall, the results showed that the respondents were more receptive to solutions that provided flexibility in the usage of social media and did not enforce any extreme measures (e.g. unfriending or unfollowing friends). It was apparent that respondents greatly valued their freedom of choice and hence, would prefer friendly reminders on their social media usage pattern or interaction with their friends over imposed actions carried out by technology based on hard-coded rules. 

Another notable observation was the important role that perception played in our respondents’ answers. If the proposed solution involved actions that could result in a negative or undesirable view of the respondent, he/she would be unlikely to adopt it, even if the benefits were scientifically proven or significantly stronger than other methods. This showed that while people were aware of the negative effects of social media and sought to mitigate them, they would not do it at the expense of their image or reputation, as that would result in far more disastrous consequences in their eyes. 

To sum it up, our two key takeaways from the survey were that people valued options and their reputation above everything else. Hence, our proposed solution has to incorporate those points to be effective.

# phase2

## Requirement Gathering

#### User Testing (paper prototype)

Using the paper prototype, our team proceeded to conduct user testing and gather additional feedback. We also worked concurrently to develop the pages on invisionapp, incorporating colours and designing a workflow for the prototype.

The plan was to obtain feedback from the paper prototype and incorporate changes to the medium-fidelity prototype on invsionapp. 
User testing results can be found in folder /....

#### Invisionapp Development

The actionable feedback we gathered from the paper prototype are:

- Consider reducing the number of tabs on the homepage (combine some of them if similar), some could be confusing and repetitive.
- Keep the colour of the interface simple and similar to Facebook and Instagram if possible.
- Consider having more selections for the drop down nav bar.

##### Changes 

Based on the feedback received, we made the necessary changes to the interface to make the app more intuitive and easy to navigate. 
The main key change was the words used for the options in the homepage. We observed that some of the participants were taking some time to understand the words on the homepage when executing the tasks given. 


### Phase 3

#### User Testing on Invisionapp 

We conducted user testing using invisionapp and gathered the following feedback:
- The colour on the pages was too bright. Consider following the layout on Instagram and Facebook which used white as their background colour. 
- The homepage tabs appeared confusing. Consider rewording them or combining some of them together. For instance, least active friends could be combined with the friend list tab while healthy social habits tab could be combined with unhealthy social habits tab.
- The rating page was redundant. Consider removing it or only asking upon the user’s first login to the site. 
- The purpose of the least active friends page was unclear.

In conclusion, we found that the overall layout was intuitive and the site was relatively easy to navigate due to the straightforward workflow. Having said that, some minor amendments would simplify the site’s content and design, thereby enhancing the overall user experience.


#### Final Touch Up

We made changes to the colour scheme and wording of the homepage to create 'familiarity' for the users. This was in response to their comments that similarities to Facebook and Instagram would serve to enhance their overall ease of usage. The number of tabs was also reduced to prevent the site from looking cluttered and overwhelming users with information. Ultimately, this would help to draw users’ attention to key content and direct their focus accordingly.
