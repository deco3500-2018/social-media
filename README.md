## 3.0 Project Summary 

Our project aims to keep our social media (Facebook and Instagram) sanitized with people whom we truly know and promote a healthy usage of such platforms. We seek to develop a prototype to enhance users’ relationships with their friends on social media by sorting friends to designated groups (e.g. least contacted). Users can then decide whether they want to retain such friends or remove them. 

In essence, it forces them to stop and ponder, “Do we really know this person and want them to have access to our information?” The odds are, they do not.

We also strived to develop a working and presentable prototype which presents a solution for helping young adults effectively manage social media and prevent feelings of overwhelm. This could come in the form of a web/mobile application, or follow an interaction paradigm such as tangible or persuasive computing.

## 4.0 Project Process

### Phase 1
#### Research 

From the initial research conducted, we found the use of social networks such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat can lead to reductions in well-being related to lowered self-confidence and life satisfaction, feelings of exclusion, anxiety, lowered self-awareness, depression and loneliness. It is commonly understood that these effects arise from users comparing themselves with others, leading to social media platforms becoming a 'competition' for beauty and self-image.

We also discovered that while social network users tend to be more well connected, greater social connectedness does not necessarily translate into meaningful and authentic friendships in reality. Social network use has also been shown to reduce the numbers and  quality of face-to-face interactions overall.

On the other hand, prior research conducted before the commencement of the project showed that there are also 'good' aspects to the use of social media. These are features that contribute positively to well-being, and include the following examples:

- Sharing feelings and stories
- Learning and understanding the self through writing and self-expression
- Finding out about real-life events, leading to 'traditional' social interaction 
- Building friendships 

Overall, social networks may be deemed a double-edged sword for teens and young adults. Amongst other things, they are a source of anxiety and concern for self-image, but also a method through which people can build friendships, express themselves and learn.


#### Existing solutions and critique

##### Articles

The solutions focused on addressing the negative effects of well-being caused by social media are largely educational and campaigns which spread awareness of these after-effects of excessive social media usage. 

In our analysis of solutions available, we found several articles on popular websites detailing why and how users should detach their lives from social media. The key articles can be accessed via the links stated below:

* [5 Reasons Why You Should Start Deleting Facebook Friends | MakeUseOf](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-reasons-start-deleting-facebook-friends/)
* [Can Deleting Facebook Friends Improve Your Life? | Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/blog/millennial-media/201108/can-deleting-facebook-friends-improve-your-life)
* [Unfollowing all my Facebook friends | Damián Le Nouaille, Medium](https://medium.com/@damln/unfollowing-all-my-facebook-friends-part-1-730ae3bc2de3)
* [Smartphones are driving us to distraction. Here’s help. | ComputerWorld](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3233286/smartphones/smartphones-are-driving-us-to-distraction-here-s-help.html)

Notably, the third article, whichh detailed how readers should unfollow all of their Facebook friends along with groups, organizations and public figures appeared to be the most intriguing. The desired outcome of the method described was to completely clear one's Facebook feed. While this was thought to be rather drastic, its main advantage would be that users would still be connected with all of their Facebook friends. The act of "unfriending" may be perceived by others as a hostile action. However, unfollowing achieves the same result, without the negative impact on how others view the user.

The main problem with these educational articles is that while readers may understand why they should reduce their footprint on social media after reading them, they are not driven to take action or change their exisiting habits that.

##### RSPH Awareness Campaigns
![#StatusOfMind Report Cover](https://www.rsph.org.uk/uploads/assets/derivatives/featuredpanelimage_852bc4924d42a7dc79b182d4b566e15c/f031018f-3134-4da1-91b802d2889fa67d.jpg)

The Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) from the UK has a social media campaign for raising awareness about social media called #StatusOfMind, which is backed by a report and several articles detailing their discovered adverse effects of social media. More recently, they have also been running a ScrollFreeSeptember campaign, which encourages youth to turn off social media over the month of September.

The impact of these campaigns is difficult to judge. As they have been centred around the UK, the level of awareness reached by these campaigns isn't apparent in Australia. One identified advantage of the RSPH initiatives, however, is that the ScrollFreeSeptember campaign encourages viewers to take action over a full month. Those that participate would then be able to see the advantages of stopping social media use, potentially adjust their habits afterwards. Another advantage is that the #StatusOfMind campaign emphasizes that some social networks have more positive impacts than others. YouTube is promoted as the healthiest social network to use while Instagram is promoted as being the worst.

The disadvantage here is that again, drastic measures are taken. By asking participants to stop the use of social media, ScrollFreeSeptember takes away from participants both the positive and negative effects afforded by social media. Similarly, in encouraging users to spend more time on Youtube than Instagram in the #StatusOfMind campaign, the RSPH have missed that those two platforms help users in different ways. "Social networking" on YouTube is one largely one-sided, and almost all users spend much more time consuming that contributing content.

##### DistractaGone

![DistractaGone smartphone locker](https://ph-files.imgix.net/99cacdbb-920c-4427-9db2-72158e21362d?auto=format&auto=compress&codec=mozjpeg&cs=strip)

In products (either software or physical) addressing the problem space, very little was found. The only solution found was DistractaGone, a box which can lock smartphones for a set amount of time. This solution not only stops users from accessing social media but all other features which are available on their smartphones. It is believed that while the district has gone can eliminate smartphone distractions over short periods of time, it isn't a long-term solution to overuse of social media. Where its users don't feel that their full attention is required somewhere else, they may fall back to old habits and continue their regular use of social media and experience that same changes in well-being that usually result.

#### Our Designs

The existing solutions found all take an all or nothing approach to social media. Users are encouraged to delete a large number of friends, unfollow everyone, stop social media usage entirely, or physically restrict themselves from using their phones. What should be recognised is that by doing this, users would close themselves off from the legitimate benefits which social networks can bring. It is likely for this reason that the methods found are not in widespread use. As stated in the section below, the prototypes developed in this project will aim to be softer in still allowing social media, but optimising it for maximum benefit.

### Design Opportunity / Concepts

The design opportunity of this project is to enhance the quality of time on social media for young adults by encouraging activities which provide a boost in well-being while discouraging activities which are known to be negative. More specifically, we want to encourage aspects of social media such as direct communication with peers, building close friendships, expression of self and discovery of real-life events while discouraging comparison of self with others and concerns about self-image.

As no existing solutions to the problem space were found which used technology to warn and persuade users, this will be an interesting design opportunity to explore. The final presented solution may come in the form of a mobile application, web application or tangible computing device and may use persuasive computing ideas to change behaviour.

Some initial concepts that we want to explore are outlined below:

##### Unfriend

This is a mobile application which intends to sit on users smartphones alongside Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. The idea will be to monitor a user's interaction with others on each social network and determine the 'friends' a user has which they haven't interacted with for a while. This could be done through monitoring of the smartphone, or by taking data from the APIs of each social media platform. If a friend hasn't been interacting with the user for a long time, the user will be alerted (e.g. notification). After some elapsed period, the user will be alerted again. If there continues to be no interaction between the two people, the application will unfriend or unfollow that person.

By providing users with alerts, the application encourages interaction between friends who haven't communicated in a long time. As friends which don't communicate at all will automatically be removed from the user's social networks, users of the application will tend to follow fewer people, and only receive updates on their feed about people that they know well.

##### Social media health orb

This is a tangible computing solution which is a colour changing orb that may sit somewhere in a user's home or be taken around with them. The orb should show either positive (green, blue, yellow) or negative (red, orange, black) colours based on the monitored social media habits of the user. The orb aims to subtly remind users whether they are spending too much time browsing through others' profiles and whether they may be spending too little time directly communicating with others. A web application may also accompany the orb, which can provide a more detailed breakdown of how the user can adjust their behaviour to maximise well-being.

##### Social networking score

An idea similar to the orb is a social media "score", which aggregates factors such as time spent scrolling feeds, types of the content looked at, the frequency of direct conversations and intimacy of conversations to summarise whether a user's behaviours may be contributing positively or negatively to their well-being. This qualifies the process of changing habits on social media towards more healthy ones and rewards users for it. This score could be presented in a variety of forms, including a mobile app, web application, or a tangible 'scoreboard' which the user might take with them. The score is not shown to others as the comparison is not the goal.

##### Warning before people follow

One way to help prevent social networking users from polluting their feeds with posts that make them feel jealous or annoyed would be to help them make decisions on whether they should follow a person or not. This could be done by creating a tool which analyses how often a person posts and the general content of those posts. The user can then be provided with some rating. This tool could also be used on people that the user is already following to help them optimise their Facebook or Instagram feed.

##### Stay in touch

Another way to encourage strong direct contact between people on social media networks is to provide a service which lets users promise each other to 'stay in touch'. While this is a commonly used phrase which is most of the time well-intentioned, people often forget to stay in contact after months or years and lose close contact. In order to use the service, both sides would need to agree to keep the promise. After a random time of no communication (months or years), the service would alert both users of the promise they had made earlier. Both users should be made aware that the opposite side has been alerted. Over time, the objective of this service is to have social network users staying in touch with more and more friends. This direct communication could then become a healthier and more engaging alternative to browsing social media. This service could be a web application, a tangible device or integrated into messaging services already in use.

##### Response reminder

A further idea which stemmed from 'Stay in touch' is a simple reminder service which can remind users to respond to messages which they may have been too busy to respond to earlier. This can help further conversation and communication, but keep users more engaged with what their friends are saying.


#### interviews/surveys

Our team started with drafting interview questions and surveys to gather an unbiased approach to decision-making for our prototype. We aim to collect unbiased survey data and develop sensible decisions based on analyzed results. 

*****interviews' results shown and conclude findings

#### our design and wireframe

Our team moved on with coming up with some low fidelity prototype using Microsoft Word.

# phase2

##### Requirement Gathering


#### user testing (paper prototype)
with the paper prototype, our team went on to conduct user testing and gather more feedback. simultaneously, we are working on developing the pages on invisionapp with colour and workflow for the prototype.

the plan is to gather feedback from the paper prototype and apply changes to the medium fidelity prototype on invsionapp. 

#### invisionapp development

the feedback we gathered from the paper prototype are ...... (refer to the paper prototype interview)

##### Changes 

based on the feedback, we made the necessary changes to the interface to make the app more intuitive and easy to navigate around. 

changes can be seem below:



### Phase 3

#### user testing on invisionapp 

we did user testing using the invisionapp and gathered some feedback.

the main (actionable) feedback were that:
- colour on the pages were too bright, consider following the layout on instagram and fb with white background colour. 
- the homepage tabs looks kinda confusing, consider rewording them or combine some of them together. such as least active friends can combine with friend list tab and healthy social habits tab can combine with unhealthy social habits tab.
- rating page was redundant? considering removing it or only ask once when the user logs in for the first time?
- keep background colour simple
- purpose of least active friends page is unclear
- rating opage is for?

conclusion
layout is intuitive, workflow is there and easy to navigate around due to the text and images. some minor touch up to be made to make it better. 

#### final touch up

we made changes to the colour on the homepage and also changed the words used to create 'familiarity' for the users as they mentioned that it's currently intuitive due to the fact that it looked similar to facebook and instagram.

- design challenges and findings (tried marvel app but changed to invisionapp, challenges faced using marvel app were?)
