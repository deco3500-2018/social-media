## Comments:
  “Why is there a rating screen at the beginning with no extra questions? Seems kind of random”
  “That home page has a lot of options”
  “What’s the difference between friends list and least active friends?”
  “Oh, you also have games in a drop-down bar”
  “The game page looks cool”
  “Wow, you really went into detail for this low fidelity”
  “Nice, like the settings button up the top”
  “What does confirmation of unfriend mean? What happens when I press it?”
  “Maybe have a blurb about with it does”
  “So, do I press friends list, or unfriends list to remove a friend?”
  “Tinder style, nice one”
   “Yes, I want to remove Jenny! She’s so annoying that Jenny”

## Interview Questions:
  1. Was there any task you had difficulty with? What specifically was difficult? 
     Friends list and least active friends list is confusing.   
  2. Was there anything in particular that wasn’t intuitive? Why?
     I initially went for the games button on the front page, but then realised you wanted me to select the games option in the 
     drop-down bar. Not so great for the front page, but I supposeits good navigation if you’re somewhere else in the app.
  3. Do you have any suggestions on how to improve the layout of the pages?
     Home page seems a bit cluttered
  4. Do you have any suggestions on how to improve the navigation between the pages?
     Maybe make the drop-down bar more obvious?
  5. Do you think this is something you would use? If not, what would need to change for you to use it?
     If there was a faster way to remove multiple old friends, perhaps. I’ve done a few Facebook culls and it takes forever, you get 
     bored half way though.
  6. Any other comments?
     Is the good/ bad social habits page just a page, or does it go elsewhere? What’s the point of it?

## Card Sorting:
  1. Which cards were hard to sort and why?
     Good Social habits, and friends list. Do you put the friends list with unfriends? Not sure if removing friends is an everyday thing,
     but it could come in handy.
  2. Which cards were easy to categorise?
     The games, and settings pages
  3. If there were any cards you couldn’t fit into a category, could you provide a new category for these cards?
     Maybe may two separate pages for good habits and bad habits?
     Not sure what would go into the holiday category, bit confused by that one.

## Comments throughout the tasks:
  “What happens to the next question?”
  “Wow, this app has a lot of features”
  “Ooo, games, lots of games”
  “Not sure I’d play Star Chef with someone, you could have picked a better game”
  “I’m going to guess least active friends...”
  “This page looks a bit like tinder”
  “what if I don’t want to delete Jenny McMillin?”

## Interview Questions:
  1. Was there any task you had difficulty with? What specifically was difficult?
     Finding the page to remove a friend
  2. Was there anything in particular that wasn’t intuitive? Why?
     Finding the page to remove a friend
  3. Do you have any suggestions on how to improve the layout of the pages?
     Add a next question to the ratings page
     Show more tasks to view all the pages
     Make the home buttons to pages more obvious
  4. Do you have any suggestions on how to improve the navigation between the pages?
     Go deeper into the app to show the extra pages
     Make the home page labels more obvious
  5. Do you think this is something you would use? If not, what would need to change for you to use it?
     I still don’t fully understand the concept. There seems to be a lot going on in this application and I haven’t really been able to 
     play around with the app to find out what each section is for completely.
  6. Any other comments?
     Let the user play around with the app before you ask them to do tasks

## Card Sorting:
  1. Which cards were hard to sort and why?
     The good habits page I didn’t really know what to do with because it wasn’t in one of the tasks.
  2. Which cards were easy to categorise?
     All of Games, Settings and remove friend seemed pretty easy to distinguish. But as I said before, haven’t used the habits page, so 
     I don’t really know where to put it, or it is its own category
  3. If there were any cards you couldn’t fit into a category, could you provide a new category for these cards?
     The ratings page doesn’t really go anyway, except with the login section. I’m still unsure why there’s only 1 question.
