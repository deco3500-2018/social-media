### Phase 3

#### User Testing on Invisionapp 

We conducted user testing using invisionapp and gathered the following feedback:
- The colour on the pages was too bright. Consider following the layout on Instagram and Facebook which used white as their background colour. 
- The homepage tabs appeared confusing. Consider rewording them or combining some of them together. For instance, least active friends could be combined with the friend list tab while healthy social habits tab could be combined with unhealthy social habits tab.
- The rating page was redundant. Consider removing it or only asking upon the user’s first login to the site. 
- The purpose of the least active friends page was unclear.

In conclusion, we found that the overall layout was intuitive and the site was relatively easy to navigate due to the straightforward workflow. Having said that, some minor amendments would simplify the site’s content and design, thereby enhancing the overall user experience.


#### Final Touch Up

We made changes to the colour scheme and wording of the homepage to create 'familiarity' for the users. This was in response to their comments that similarities to Facebook and Instagram would serve to enhance their overall ease of usage. The number of tabs was also reduced to prevent the site from looking cluttered and overwhelming users with information. Ultimately, this would help to draw users’ attention to key content and direct their focus accordingly.
