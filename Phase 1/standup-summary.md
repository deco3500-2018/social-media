At this stage in the project, our initial primary research has been complete, and the data gathered indicates that there is a demand for a service which helps young adults in improving their social media experience. This is from the preliminary research, interviews and survey conducted.

Since almost all interview participants indicated that they used Facebook and Instagram, we've decided to split our prototype into 2 parts.

For Facebook:

* Find friends which a user has interacted the least with, and suggest to unfriend / unfollow them
* Find friends which users haven't talked in a long time, and suggest that they play games / restart a chat with those friends

For Instagram:

* Survey users on their well-being while using Instagram and identify their followers to correlate Instagram well-being with feed content
* Suggest that users who follow 'harmful' accounts to unfollow those accounts to achieve better well-being.

Over the next week, Phoebe will construct a lo-fi prototype.
Eugene and Nicholas will work on a medium-fi prototype.
Darren will investigate the stack and APIs which maybe used to achieve the goals of the prototype.

Further data analysis should be done of the interview and survey results to inform design decisions for the prototype.
