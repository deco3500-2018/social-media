# Purpose

* From this interview, we want to have an understanding of what social media platform we will focus our prototype on
* What aspects people favour most or least and develop potential aspects into our design
* Are we trying to find out how often people are using social media. Do we want to get users to use social media less or more? Or just getting them to use social media for more positive interactions?
* We want to have an understanding why people have a large or smaller group of friends on social media.
* Why they feel inclined/ less inclined to talk to all their friends/ be interactive with them
* We want to know why people stay friends with people online, even though they don’t find these friendship meaningful.

## Part II

By now it should be obvious what our idea is, but present our idea and ask for advice on how our goal could be completed.

Design activity: Given the problems that the interviewee has with social media, how do you think they could solve those problems?

Present 2 of the ideas in the list of concepts from the proposal document, but speak vaguely about the concrete details of how the idea could be implemented. Ask the interviewee on what their thoughts might be on the idea, whether they might use it, and how they think an idea like this could be implemented.
