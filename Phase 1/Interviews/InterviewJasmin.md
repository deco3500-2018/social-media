## Part I

##### What is your most used social media platform?

-     Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat
-     45%, 30%, 25%

##### What is your main reason for using social media?

-     Facebook is for events and updates and sales. Shops.

-     Messenger for talking to people.

-     Snapchat, I don't know why? To send photos 

-     I even have streaks on snapchat, but every time I'm doing it, I'm not even sure why. It's so pointless. I have 9, all over 100 days, except for 1. It's so boring. The other side isn't making an effort.

-     XX's streak's are the worst. It's just a picture of a mousepad.

-     Instagram: I don't know. Just because of people's photos, and mostly funny things. Scroll through explore for hours. 

-     I've been really into one account and they rate emojis. There was a cookie emoji and it would give long descriptions and rate them for different companies. Just to be funny.

-     I come back to Instagram for this kind of content.

##### When do you usually use social media?

-     All the time. Whenever I'm bored, which is all the time. Not when I'm looking at the emoji ratings.

-     Mostly on my phone. It's easier. It's easier to scroll.

##### What is your favourite part about using social media?

-     I like knowing what other people are doing. Where they've been. I like snap maps. I used to have my location off, now I have it on. It makes it easier cause I can know whether they're home or not. You can see when they're last online. Snap maps is more accurate on last seen than messenger.

-     I don't like waiting.

-     I know if they're ignoring me, it would say like seen 10 minutes ago.

##### What is your least favourite part about using social media?

-     When you see people doing cool things, you feel sad cause you want to be doing cool things as well.

-     An example of that would be when I'm seeing people on snapmaps, say at toowong shopping centre and I'm not there.

-     Really nice photos of people at nice restaurants. I follow lots of food accounts.

-     I'm just always hungry.

##### What are your thoughts on your own social media usage?

-     I look at other people's things, I don't really post.

-     I think my friends use social media more than I do. They post many times per week, on multiple accounts.

##### What do you think of your friends social media usage compared to you?

-     *Ignored*

##### How many friends do you have on (insert most used platform as mentioned above)?

-     272

-     I unfriended lots of people, I don't really care about what they do. People I haven't talked to in years. Or share and like stupid things.

-     I followed most of my friends on Facebook. I go through my feed, and if they have multiple posts that aren't interesting I unfollow them.

-     I only follow people that don't share or post anything, or people that I talk to more.

-     It's sort of like a 3 strikes system.

-     I unfriend if I don't want them to see what I'm doing. If I don't like them anymore. Once every few months to see if there's anyone I don't like anymore.

##### How many of those friends do you constantly keep in touch with?

-     Not many, ....

-     Like 20. A lot of them I've only met a few times.

-     If I've only met them once, I'd probably unfriend them.

-     Now my feed is curated. I have food videos, sales and funny videos. I like to see pictures of good friends, but anyone else I don't really care.

-     Oh, I forget to say that I use Facebook a lot to tag people in things. Usually cause it's relevant. If I have a friend who really loves cats, I can tag them to related content.

##### Why do you no longer keep in contact with these friends?

-     Usually in Perth and Melbourne. I don't really care about them anymore. If they say hi, I'd say hi back, but wouldn't want to reach out.

##### Do you find staying friends with these people on social media meaningful to your life?

-   I have one friend from perth and one friend from melbourne who I stay in touch with, but it's not really meaningful. There isn't much to talk about.

##### How would you feel if you were no longer friends with the people you donâ€™t constantly stay in contact with?

-     I wouldn't care.

*ADD any more questions you would like to add to the interview*

## Part II

*By now it should be obvious what our idea is, but present our idea and ask for advice on how our goal could be completed.*

### Design activity: Given the problems that the interviewee has with social media, how do you think they could solve those problems?

-     I wouldn't know how to solve this. People would just do what they want. Perhaps we could reward them. People like earning points. You could redeem points. Connect to QANTAS frequent flyer and Woolworths rewards points.

### Your choice: Present 2 of the ideas in the list of concepts from the proposal document, but speak vaguely about the concrete details of how the idea could be implemented. Ask the interviewee on what their thoughts might be on the idea, whether they might use it, and how they think an idea like this could be implemented.


Unfriend:

This would be a great idea. You wouldn't even need to unfriend yourself. This removes the guilt of unfriending, and there would be no hard feelings on the other end because they'd know that it was done by an app rather than deliberately.

I would use this. On Facebook and Instagram.

Stay in touch:

That would be cool, it's kinda cute. After a while, people might feel weird about reaching out. A service that does this would help.

With people from perth and melbourne, I don't really care enough.

You wouldn't know what to talk about. There would be no pros and no cons. It wouldn't benefit me in any way.

I have a friend who left for columbia when I was in grade 5, and then we promised to see each other again. This hasn't happened.
