## Outcome from the interview

From this interview, we want to have an understanding of what social media platform we will focus our prototype on
What aspects people favour most or least and develop potential aspects into our design.
Are we trying to find out how often people are using social media. Do we want to get users to use social media less or more? Or just getting them to use social media for more positive interactions?
We want to have an understanding why people have a large or smaller group of friends on social media.
Why they feel inclined/ less inclined to talk to all their friends/ be interactive with them
We want to know why people stay friends with people online, even though they don’t find these friendship meaningful.
