## Part I

##### What is your most used social media platform?

-     Facebook, Instagram, Wechat, Line, Steam, Reddit

-     Facebook, Snapchat, 

-     Facebook is what I use to talk to everyone
-     Snapchat is what I use to talk to 3 people
-     Wechat I use to talk to one person - my mum
-     Reddit I use to talk to 0 people
-     0 people on Instagram
-     I talk to 0 people on Instagram
-     Discord I use to talk to 0 people
-     90% of my attention would go in facebook, and the rest are split evenly among the others

##### What is your main reason for using social media?

-     I use grindr sometimes. That's for when I'm you know, feeling it. I'm kidding. I don't have a grindr account.

-     To talk to my friends and to purvey people I don't know. We won't get into details about my purveying.

-     I use instagram to look at photos. I don't actually use it socially.

-     I use Facebook to talk to my friends and to read the newsfeed when I'm really bored and I do this because I have nothing else worthwhile in my life.

-     When I scroll through my newsfeed on Facebook, it's like scrolling through a montage of what my life could've been. (I'm like 20% serious about that, I don't actually feel that. I don't think anyone actually thinks that. Instinctively, I dont' think actually feel this way. Even if they're dissatisfied with their lives. What they feel is they lack something. 

-     Deeper down, it's a more complicated feeling. The photos make you remind yourself of what you lack. You do this cause it validates this lacking feeling inside of you, that other people are living better lives than you are. It's counter intuitive to do this. But the people that do it, they continue to browse social media because they feel like they deserve it. I'm aware of this feeling.

-     When looking I photos on social media, when sad, you would see photos of people having fun. And you don't think that you wish you were there. But what you feel is that they're having something that you're sort of lack. Almost like, you're a sad person, and you don't belong in this world where everyone is having fun. This is not a general feeling, but I can also say that I have been sad in my life and this is a ... these are the conclusions I come to, about the things I do while I'm sad.

-     I think other people who are sad experience this as well. There is more similarity here with sad people, than sad people have with normal people.

-     You tend to stalk people more on Facebook when you're sad. You'd be more anxious to talk to people, but you would look at their profiles to see how great of a life they've had. The more likes, photos, comments, activity, more well received, the more you feel that their life is better than yours and that they are living such a great life and they are happy and they have what you don't have and that's when you want to be like them, that's when you wish you were like them. I wish I could be them. Especially when you don't know them, less so when you know them deeply. This can occur when you know them deeply, when they have a life separate to what they have with you. The feeling is stronger and more frequent when you know them less. And these are very intuitive feelings I think.)

-     Sometimes when I scroll through my Facebook feed, I wonder where I would be if my dad didn't beat me when I was young. Just kidding. My dad didn't beat me when I was young.

##### What is your favourite part about using social media?

-     It's a convenient tool to talk to my friends when they're not in close proximity.

-     It's a convenient event calendar for when there's an event on facebook where you don't have to write it down. Gives you reminders when it's coming up etc...

-     Social media is a new platform for creativity that doesn't exist in physical space. You can share things on social media that you wouldn't' be as satisfied sharing in real life.
-     When you share something in real life, they have to give more involved feedback than if they saw it on social media.

-     I think social media does not make you new friends. You don't find new friends on social. If you do, it's uncommon, and the friendships you make are, i don't want to say less valuable, but it feels like it could be harder to maintain. You definitely will not make new friends online/ on facebook or something like, ..., you're not adding people randomly, that's not a thing that happens. Maybe this happens on Instagram or Snapchat, but I don't really know. This is possible on places like reddit or other online communities, but once again, these friendships are hard to maintain. And if you want to make these friendships online, most of the time, there has to be some kind of common activity with those friends. e.g. Online games. On places where you're just messaging strangers, trying to see if something clicks, where there is no shared activity, you don't get the free flowing conversation that comes in real life talk. It's pretty hard to integrate small talk.

##### What is your least favourite part about using social media?

-     I know that people sometimes say that facebook puts pressure on people to share photos of themselves having fun, but I don't think this feeling is as tangible as you might think. It's a lot more complicated than that.
-     It's just a tool.

-     These social media apps don't cause the bad feelings that people have, those are instinctual feelings that come from the .... Like, ...

-     They come from the person is what I'm trying to say. Not from the app.

-     I feel that there's nothing particularly.., I don't like or hate social media.

-     There's all that stuff about Facebook leaking and selling data, people are really upset about that. I don't understand how its impacted my life, so I don't understand why they would be so upset about it.

##### What are your thoughts on your own social media usage?

-     I think my social media usage is , talking to friends, newsfeed, is average. Is normal like other people.

-     This is where I'm average with other people.

-     The difference between between a happy and unhappy person on facebook is what they use that social platform for, and how it makes them feel.

-     When I'm unhappy, I go on facebook to look at people's profiles. What a great life they're having, and stuff. I'm looking through the comments of the posts where people are getting tags, seeing who's getting tagged, seeing what they're commenting and how much fun they're having... that's the basic idea

-     I'm going through instagram and snapchat stories to the same effect. Seeing other people take their great photos and show that they're enjoying themselves. Expressing themselves and reminding myself of how i'm not doing that. Ummm... Yea, that's ... I don't know what else,, if there's much else to say about it.

##### What do you think of your friends social media usage compared to you?

-     As above.

##### How many friends do you have on (insert most used platform as mentioned above)?

-     300

##### How many of those friends do you constantly keep in touch with?

-     10-20. It's a big range. Consistently it's a big range.

-     Depending on what time? I guess so.

##### Why do you no longer keep in contact with these friends?

-     Because the app is just a tool, the real social process occurs in person and depends on how often you see each other and the obligations you have together. If you're class with them or you play a sport or a game you'll talk to them more. If you don't do anything with them, you'll talk to them less because you see them less.

-     Some friends that went to difference unis as me, I barely talked to them. But if they where to come to the same university as me, I'd probably talk to them more. Facebook is just a tool that facilitates the social process.

##### Do you find staying friends with these people on social media meaningful to your life?

-     Facebook is just a tool. The real socialising occurs in real life. It depends on how often you see them. Shared engagements you have with them. So if you stop talking to someone cause you don't have the shared engagements anymore, then I think initially, you might...

-     If you plan on seeing them again, (go on exchange and will come back) it is in your interest to stay in touch. Say you know you won't see them again, maybe initially keep in touch. But over time, real life doesn't facilitate....

-     You'd talk to them less on social media. This is a general rule, there are exception. You will meet other people, and you'll find new friends. Facebook is just a tool that facilitates the social process.

##### How would you feel if you were no longer friends with the people you donâ€™t constantly stay in contact with?

-     After you've lost contact, it's probably been a long time since you talked. You also probably lost contact cause you know longer have those shared engagements. If you were close and really good friends I guess (there was no fallout) maybe you would over time talk to them less cause you have less reason to. Especially if you don't plan on coming back. If you met them in person again, you would still talk to them fine. But on the other hand, if your friendship had a falling out, then, the feeling of not talking to them is the same as the same as not talking to them in person. Which is unfortunate, not a great result, but it happened for some reason. You accept it I guess. You wouldn't feel great about it. I know this because this has happened to me. This is the social process, this is just what happens in your life. Facebook only facilitates this.

-     I think the fundamental workings of the social process remain the same, but Facebook has opened new avenues to express that social process. Instead of calling someone, you could tag them in a meme. That's a new kind of shared.. a new kind of conversation, in the same way, you can share things on social media that would be inconvenient to share without social media and inconvenient to view before social media. e.g. pictures of food, that wouldn't have been practical at all before social media. Facebook is just a tool that facilitates the social process.

-     Strangers, friends, close friends, remain who they are.

## Part II

*By now it should be obvious what our idea is, but present our idea and ask for advice on how our goal could be completed.*

### Design activity: Given the problems that the interviewee has with social media, how do you think they could solve those problems?

-     I think the idea behind your project is not possible. Facebook is just a tool. When you're upset, the way you do things... Or when you're not upset....

-     Using Facebook as a tool for connectedness is a naive way of looking at it. It doesn't ... before, you'd just use phone calls to do this

-     I don't see where the greater sense of connected comes from with using social media.

### Your choice: Present 2 of the ideas in the list of concepts from the proposal document, but speak vaguely about the concrete details of how the idea could be implemented. Ask the interviewee on what their thoughts might be on the idea, whether they might use it, and how they think an idea like this could be implemented.

Unfriend:

The obvious counter example that comes to mind is that there are some people that you are great friends with that you basically never talk to on Facebook. I might talk to them on some other platform.

I think this would only be quantifiable for people you are really not close to. Because some people ... you could be... for the purpose of not seeing their photos, I'm not sure how this can be applied outside of Facebook... 

I don't think it would change anything, you'd still see photos for people that you talk to of people having fun, living cool lives when you're not there. I don't know how you could measure interactivity...

I follow this one girl on instagram who i haven't talked to for 3 months. But her photos are amazing. I'd like to keep that content 

There's this person that's a good friend to talk to, that I never talk to on Facebook, and if your algorithm just detected that and unfriended us, i'd be what the hell?

It might help some people? Perhaps some people get really affected. An app like this in no way relates to my experience.

Stay in touch:

This is a terrible idea. Even worse than your previous idea. The social media platform is just a tool that facilitates the social process. If you guys aren't talking there's probably a real life reason for why.

It would be awkward, you wouldn't know them that well. Something like this is too much of a double edged sword. On one hand, there could be someone you lost contact with, you're still friends, cause you don't see them again in real life. You still have them on Facebook. There would be no reason to talk to them. You can't account for this. Generally awkward for people.

If the other person declines to talk to you, ..... that's not gonna make you feel good!

What do you think would be a legitimate solution?

This is not an electronic related problem. These apps are all just tools. If you want to fix this problem, you should fix mental health in society in general. You should promote mental health awareness? Perhaps there's a tool you could make, that could help people talk about their problems. Cause that might help. Maybe make a tool that connects people to therapists more convenient. Maybe just a counselor, they might not be sick. You could have an app that connects people to other people when they want to share their problems to strangers. They might talk about this with strangers because they might not want to talk about this with friends. Strangers might be unhelpful though. Perhaps there could be a forum that does this, but reddit already does this.

This problem is fundamental. It cannot be solved electronically.
