## Part I

##### What is your most used social media platform?

-     Steam, Slack and Facebook. If you count steam as a social network at all. 

-     Facebook, just messenger, for messaging people about uni.

-     I use reddit occasionally. Use it for browsing. I love how people congratulate people for really stupid things. Shithouse art. Reddit is about being nice to people. Isn't it a bit insincere? People try to enforce their opinions, if you're right wing, good luck.

-     Steam is for playing games. --- Which high school friends are online.

-     Messenger is on my phone.

-     I have a linkedin, but I haven't used it for about a year. Linkedin isn't even for smart people, its for people that are pretending to be smart that want to look businesslike.

-     I need to know if people are trying to get into contact with me.

-     "If I don't see someone for years, I just avoid eye contact. Just cut them off completely."

-     There's one guy that I message.

-     Most of the time, other people message me rather than the other way round. Maybe it's cause I'm a shy guy.

-     What is your main reason for using social media?

-     See above. I spend most of my time on 4chan. You can sort of sit there and just look at people and what they have said.

-     It's a bit flamboyant to advertise yourself on social media. It's not really a thing for me.

##### What is your favourite part about using social media?

-     I didn't even have Facebook until last year. The only way to contact me was through steam.

-     It's good to use Facebook messenger for assignments.

-     It's really good to be able to contact business like EAIT and UQ Employability.

-     Check out employability job listings.

##### What is your least favourite part about using social media?

-     Nothing. I don’t hate it that much, I just don't really use it.

-     ost of the time I don't really care about what other people care about on Facebook.

-     Sometimes when people post about people more accomplished than me, I would feel jealous.

-     If it's an accomplishment that I don't care about, I wouldn't care.

-     On LinkedIn, people are just there to get a job. It feels dirty cause I don't like businesses.

-     Sometimes, because I habitually don't check Facebook, I miss out on events.

##### What are your thoughts on your own social media usage?

-     I'd like to use 4chan less. The main ones I don't use too much.

##### What do you think of your friends social media usage compared to you?

-     Most of my friends don't use social media that much. There's this chick on Facebook that's got it open every lecture. Looking at all this dumb shit.

*Like, you're here to learn?*

##### So then I pose the question, what do you think of our concept?

-     I don't care too much about people who use social media. Smart people don't use social media. People that use social media are typically people I wouldn't be jealous of.

-     There's this really nice guy that I know, super clever, semi pro video game player, highly accomplished. And he also posts on social media sometimes as well. I don't want to be the sort of person that looks at his accomplishments and then feels jealous about it. That would bring me down to those people that get depressed on social media.

##### How many friends do you have on (insert most used platform as mentioned above)?
-     < ~100 Facebook, I have no idea honestly

##### How many of those friends do you constantly keep in touch with?

-     1 friend that I consistently keep in touch of. And then there's a civil engineering group chat.

##### Why do you no longer keep in contact with these friends?

-     There isn't much to talk about. If I talk to someone, I think about all the ways that the conversation could go wrong.

##### Do you find staying friends with these people on social media meaningful to your life?

-     Not at all.

##### How would you feel if you were no longer friends with the people you don’t constantly stay in contact with?

-     I'm not really sure. Perhaps I could call him?

-     Most of the people that use social media don't have interests that are similar to mine.

## Part II

*By now it should be obvious what our idea is, but present our idea and ask for advice on how our goal could be completed.*

## Design activity: Given the problems that the interviewee has with social media, how do you think they could solve those problems?

*We were running low on time.*

## Your choice: Present 2 of the ideas in the list of concepts from the proposal document, but speak vaguely about the concrete details of how the idea could be implemented. Ask the interviewee on what their thoughts might be on the idea, whether they might use it, and how they think an idea like this could be implemented.

Unfriend:

This is not a problem that needs to be solved. There isn't much stuff in my feed that I don't care about it.

I would prefer if we used a more free and open platform.

Stay In Touch:

I would not use this service. I think it's a gimmick, perhaps something that could be built into Facebook. Perhaps the target audience would be someone who is a bit more social. But for me, if I would be willing to make a promise with someone to 'stay in touch', I'd probably do it anyway without the help with the service.
