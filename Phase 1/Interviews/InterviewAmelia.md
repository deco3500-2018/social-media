## Interview questions
 
### Part I
 
##### What is your most used social media platform?
-     fb
##### What is your main reason for using social media?
-     to get updated on the latest happening and to see how my friends are doing. 
##### When do you usually use social media?
-     use it during my leisure time such as times when i am doing nothing or when i receive a notification.
##### What is your favourite part about using social media?
-     variety of content which is available on the platform, makes it interesting to read. Just one platform and i can view the stuff that i like.
##### What is your least favourite part about using social media?
-     to see frequent post from the same person can be a little repetitive and may appear as information overload about that particular person. 
##### What are your thoughts on your own social media usage?
-     low to moderate. Because i am not naturally inclined to check it and can do without it. A tool to socialise, that’s about it. 
##### What do you think of your friends social media usage compared to you?
-     my friends are rather active users on social media. I can roughly gauge based on the content they posted.
 ##### How many friends do you have on (insert most used platform as mentioned above)?
-     About 600 friends
##### How many of those friends do you constantly keep in touch with?
-     Around 10
##### Why do you no longer keep in contact with these friends?
-     They were friends met along the way and I do not see a need to establish a closer friendship. So friends on social media would suffice.
##### Do you find staying friends with these people on social media meaningful to your life?
-     Yes, broaden my horizons and know more about the world. 
##### How would you feel if you were no longer friends with the people you don’t constantly stay in contact with? 
-     ambivalent.


### Concept 
 App unfriend – it’s an extreme measure to take because that does not mean i do not want to befriend with the person. Lack of contact can be due to multiple reasons but unfriending on my behalf is extreme. 

Social media health orb - it’s good because it serves as a good reminder. 
 
Stay in touch – people use many tools to stay in touch and while they may have a very close friendship offline, online friendship might be ‘cold’ so this might be redundant.
