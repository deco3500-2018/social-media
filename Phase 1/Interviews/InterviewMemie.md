## Interview questions
 
## Part I
 
##### What is your most used social media platform?
-     Instagram, fb
#####  What is your main reason for using social media?
-     Get bored really easily, need a lot of simulation. So many things on the news feed helps with the simulation portion. I am able to see everything in a short period of time. Fb is more for talking to ppl, personal messaging.
#####  When do you usually use social media?
-     Uni, in classes cause I get bored really easily. Use it as a way to procrastinate. When I am alone in public. 
##### What is your favourite part about using social media?
-     Stay updated with what’s happening with my friends, trends, hashtags. Checking news feed. They are really accessible. Another favourite thing for me is to go for a walk but I still have to prepare for it, but with Instagram, just a phone is enough.
##### What is your least favourite part about using social media?
-     It can be addictive. Time consuming. Short term simulation. Temporary escape. It doesn’t help with my short attention span.
#####  What are your thoughts on your own social media usage?
-     Excessive. It becomes second nature. Becomes a habit, a bad one. The logic is similar to people who smokes. They are not addicted to nicotine but just smoke due to habits.
#####  What do you think of your friends social media usage compared to you?
-     They use them moderately I think. They still get things done. Able to prioritise their stuff. Compared to you(nick), you still go out. Just think I use social media way too much. Can get more things done when I don’t use it. Social media can be really negative at times due to bad news.
##### How many friends do you have on (insert most used platform as mentioned above)?
-     385 on Instagram. 512 on FB
#####  How many of those friends do you constantly keep in touch with?
-     Around 30
#####  Why do you no longer keep in contact with these friends?
-     Different countries, nothing to talk about. Keep them cause I don’t know when can we reconnect again. See how it goes. 
##### Do you find staying friends with these people on social media meaningful to your life?
-     Not really. If they delete me, I wont mind.
#####  How would you feel if you were no longer friends with the people you don’t constantly stay in contact with? 
-     Nothing.

## Concept 
 
App unfriend – facebook would have memories. 3 years ago. Those help to reignite memories. Maybe will catch up if using the reminder. Comment each other on the post. Maybe not so much in a group but reminder for a one to one memories. Uni friend from thai secondary and just delete them. Doing activities together so just add them to not to be rude.
 
Stay in touch – facebook can poke people and send waving message too. This idea might be awkward too. It can redundant after a while if too many reminders have been sent and both parties just ignore them, thinking that it’s the function of the app.
 
Social networking score

People can fake a score. Might not be useful. Cause people would want to look good on the score board and fake stuff. That could lead to the score board being unreliable after awhile. 
 
##### Extra feedback

-     I personally like the memory reminder on fb. It helps. It’s a strong reminder because of the images. Instead of image, can remind things such as liking each other post. Good happy things reminder would create more opportunity to reconnect people. Make each other feel good first. Memories such as tagging people on fb in the past can make the person initiate a check in with the other person.
