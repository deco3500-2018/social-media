## Part I

##### What is your most used social media platform?

-     Facebook, Instagram and Line

-     5 hours of them combined
-     Use an app called moment to measure how much use

-     Facebook and instagram are similarly used and then line depends on whether I'm talking to anyone

##### What is your main reason for using social media?

-     Follow up on what others are doing and to communicate with people

-     Line is for one to one communication

-     Facebook is for posting photos

-     Instagram is posting more emotional texts 

-     There's more close friends on instagram than Facebook, so that's where I share things that are more private.

-     For fun and to kill time and to procrastinate

-     Moment is used to limit my procrastination

-     Pokemon Go would be 20 minutes a day

-     Snapchat is when I'm travelling, so on average 5 minutes per day

##### When do you usually use social media?

-     Pokemon Go mostly on public transport

-     Instagram more likely at home, sometimes at uni, sometimes in class
-     Facebook is more on laptop.

-     Messenger is on phone

-     Line is usually communicating with people anywhere

-     Different people are on Line and on Messenger.

-     My friends and family from Taiwan are usually on Line.

-     Australian friends and group mates are usually on messenger.

-     People from Taiwan and Japan use Line, People from Hong Kong use WhatsApp, People from China use WeChat, People from Australia use Messenger

##### What is your favourite part about using social media?

-     Does Pokemon Go count? Sometimes I go to gyms to fight pokemon, and then end up chatting with other people (not in the app).

-     I met 2 people in Toronto playing Pokemon Go, and we are now Facebook friends.

-     Facebook is to see what's happening in life. Learn things about taiwan now that I'm in australia. Schoolmates and teachers from taiwan.

-     It's really funny to see what teachers post.

-     Line is communicating with people.

-     Instagram is seeing friends around and what they are doing.

-     When I first came to australia, I used line more and now and use messenger.

##### What is your least favourite part about using social media?

-     Time consuming. Addictive. Instagram and Facebook are addictive. There's new stuff to read and watch. Not much else.

##### What are your thoughts on your own social media usage?

-     I use too much. I'd be enjoying my life. It's a bit of a waste of time. (99% of the time)

-     But then sometimes, I might find out that someone goes somewhere. And then the next time I see them I can ask.
-     Catch up on their life basically.

##### What do you think of your friends social media usage compared to you?

-     Maybe less? Some people use different platforms.

-     Most of my friends use platforms similarly to me.

-     How many friends do you have on (insert most used platform as mentioned above)?

-     750

##### How many of those friends do you constantly keep in touch with?

-     Perhaps 100.

##### Why do you no longer keep in contact with these friends?

-     They disappeared. Losing contact. You can still follow up on their lives on Facebook if they post something. Some are just group mates that.

-     I wouldn't unfriend them though.

-     I wouldn't mind if people are unfriended me.

-     Recently I found out that someone unfriended or blocked me on Facebook. It’s OK though, they were going through a hard time.

##### Do you find staying friends with these people on social media meaningful to your life?

-     I don't quite get this question.

-     It's something that's worthwhile to do.

##### How would you feel if you were no longer friends with the people you don’t constantly stay in contact with?

-     Ok fine.

-     Sometimes I do reconnect with them. Sometimes I might ask how you're going. But sometimes you don't really have much to chat about.

## Part II

*By now it should be obvious what our idea is, but present our idea and ask for advice on how our goal could be completed.*

## Design activity: Given the problems that the interviewee has with social media, how do you think they could solve those problems?

-     Umm, usually I'm that one posting a lot of travel pictures. I don't usually feel guilty, but when I post pictures, I want people to say that the pictures are good. The idea isn't about telling people that I travel a lot and it's not about showing off.

-     I'm showing off my photography skills.

-     If they are depressed, it's not my fault.

-     I have a friend who says that every time I see your pictures, I feel good. I feel healed.

-     I'm sharing my pictures.

-     If you are sad, you look at everything as sad. It's not because of the social media. It's because of you.

-     I don't think this problem can be solved through some electronic means.

-     I do believe that social media 'reinforces' depression.

-     Say that someone tells you that they went to japan. You might feel a little bit depressed about it. But then on social media, there might be lots of people showing off on what they've done, which increases the depression.

-     Perhaps you could do a counselling app, which might solve this problem.

-     It would eliminating (there will be less) the entire problem of depression, rather than the problem of social media.

-     I think there's an app called smile mind, which people might use.
